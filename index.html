            <p>Hello! My name is Angelus Akomiah Sackey and I am from Ghana in the West Africa, I am currently in the final phase of completing my certificate and pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Technology. My family consists of my wife, three children, and myself. I have skills in maintaining and repairing various types of equipment and machines, including HVAC systems, mechanical devices, plumbing, carpentry, pumps, and motors, despite having a solid background in electrical work. I am proficient in using computers for work purposes. I am a quick learner and can adapt easily to changes to achieve organizational goals. Being a part of the BYU-Idaho online school community has been a great experience for me since I started this journey in September 2019. It has been a blessing for me. Even though I am a full-time employee, a Bishop, and an online student, I manage to stay busy and focused. Trusting in the Lord and having a growth mindset has been key to my success</p>
