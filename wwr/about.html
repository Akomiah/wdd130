            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>For centuries, water has played a significant role in transportation. Native Americans utilized canoes and rafts to navigate the extensive waterways of North America. In 1869, Major John Wesley Powell led a scientific rafting expedition of the Green and Colorado Rivers with four wooden boats and ten men.</p>
            <p>Though their boats were not designed for Colorado whitewater rafting, the men were forced to hold on tight during many rapids. Kayak slalom's inclusion in the Munich Olympic Games in the 1970s brought attention to whitewater sports. The equipment and tools used for whitewater rafting continued to evolve throughout the '70s and '80s, culminating in the modern equipment used today.</p>
