                                    <img src="images/Australia-rafting.jpg" alt="North Johnstone River Rafting"></p>
                                      <p>The North Johnstone River in Australia is known to be one of the most thrilling white-water experiences and boasts one of the longest runs in the region. This river flows through a canyon surrounded by dense rainforest, waterfalls, dark basalt cliffs, and exotic wildlife. Its source is found about 450 miles above in the World Heritage rainforests of Palmerston National Park. Rafting trips usually commence from an old converted dairy farm located at Mulgalli Falls, which is a two-hour drive from Cairns. From there, the rafters and equipment are helicoptered into the heart of the rainforest to start their 4 to 6-day journey.</p>
